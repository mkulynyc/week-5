There seems to be a discrepancy between the last name counts and family size.
For instance, the largest family size is 11, but the largest last name count is 9 (Andersson).
There are other examples of this as well.

Question:
What is the distribution of family sizes on the Titanic, and how does that relate to fare prices?
